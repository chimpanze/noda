## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `auth.jwt` optional claim validation: `audience`, `issuer`, and `require_expiry` (all default off — when unset, behavior is unchanged)
- Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) with OTel metrics API
- Trace sampling rate configuration (`observability.tracing.sampling_rate`)
- Circuit breaker support for outbound HTTP services (`circuit_breaker` config)
- Per-workflow timeout configuration (`timeout` field in workflow definitions)
- Redis-backed distributed rate limiting (`storage: "redis"` in limiter config)
- JWT support for RSA (RS256/384/512) and ECDSA (ES256/384/512) algorithms
- Request ID propagation from HTTP middleware through workflow execution and logs
- Secrets redaction in trace events and log output
- Idempotency middleware with Redis backend
- Health check timeout (default 5s) to prevent hung service checks
- `gosec` security linter with tuned exclusion rules
- CHANGELOG.md
- `server.trust_proxy` — trusted-proxy support so `c.IP()` (rate limiting, session IPs) sees the real client behind a reverse proxy (#300)
- numeric `server.*` settings (`port`, `body_limit`, `expression_memory_budget`) accept `{{ $env('NAME') }}` strings (#301)
- `noda.DecodeInto` in the Go PDK — typed decode for `Command.Data`/`ClientMessage.Data`/`IncomingWSMsg.Data`; both example guests use it (#294)
- CI now compiles every example wasm guest module with tinygo, so PDK/ABI changes can't silently break them (#296)

### Changed
- invalid `server.*` scalar values (bad numbers, malformed durations, invalid trust_proxy entries) now fail config validation/startup instead of silently falling back to defaults
- `lk.token` now errors on invalid `canPublishSources` (unknown names, non-string entries, non-array values) instead of silently minting a token with wrong publish permissions (#309)
- the wasm module's outstandingCalls invariant is now structural (`tryAddOutstanding`), not comment-enforced (#295)
- wasm: a guest shutdown export calling trigger_workflow now gets a "module stopping" error instead of silently spawning a doomed workflow run against an already-cancelled context (#295)
- config validation now rejects route triggers whose `files` entries lack a matching `trigger.input` key — configs that previously booted with silently-broken uploads fail `noda validate` (#302)
- `lk.participantUpdate` with empty `permissions: {}` no longer performs a GetParticipant + Permission full-replace round-trip (#292)
- Wasm runtime hardening (tranche A) — **BREAKING (guest ABI):** host calls now return a `{ok,data,error}` envelope decoded by the PDK into `HostError`; rebuild guest modules against the updated PDK. Guest execution is now interruptible; default 16 MiB memory cap.
- Route-group middleware now resolves **deterministically**: overlapping group prefixes (e.g. `/api` and `/api/admin`) **merge** their middleware (outermost-first, deduped) instead of one winning at random, and prefix matching is path-segment aware (`/api` no longer matches `/api-docs`). **Upgrade note:** a config that nested groups with a cross-group ordering conflict (e.g. a parent group placing `casbin.enforce` before a child group's `auth.jwt`) previously booted non-deterministically but now fails fast at route registration with a clear ordering error — reorder the affected groups to fix.
- Dockerfile: non-root user, HEALTHCHECK directive, embedded editor build, version metadata via ldflags
- WebSocket/SSE connections are now gracefully closed during shutdown
- The committed `testdata/auth` fixture is regenerated from the current auth templates (verification-first register, constant-time pads, atomic reset) and a new drift-guard test fails whenever the templates change without a fixture regeneration; the auth engine e2e now exercises the hardened flows.
- Worker reaper polls at `retry.min_idle / 2` (30s floor) instead of a fixed 30s, and fetches delivery counts for each reclaimed page in one `XPENDING` call instead of one per failed message — fewer idle Redis scans, same redelivery semantics
- wildcard channel matching is removed from the connection manager entirely — Send/SendSSE reject pattern channels at the chokepoint (all production callers already rejected them; the Manager-level wildcard delivery capability was unreachable and is deleted) (#279)
- scheduled job runs record job history entries for same-instance overlap skips (`skipped` with a new `SkipReason: "overlap"` distinguishing them from `SkipReason: "lock"` distributed-lock skips) (#284)
- the worker's per-message timeout is applied once (runtime-owned); the `worker.timeout` middleware keeps its config name but is now the panic-to-error shield only (#285)

### Fixed
- homebase: `GET /drops` returns 400 (not a Postgres-cast 500) on a malformed `before` cursor; pagination gains a `(created_at, id)` tuple cursor (`before_id`/`next_before_id`) so same-timestamp rows can't be skipped (#303)
- homebase: concurrent `/setup` can no longer create two accounts — single-row unique index on `auth_users` (#304)
- homebase: Caddy moved to a `docker-compose.edge.yml` override; an unset `DOMAIN` fails at parse time again instead of an opaque ACME error (#305)
- `examples/saas-backend` upload-attachment route never delivered the multipart file (missing `"file"` input mapping) (#302)
- `wasm.query` no longer burns its full timeout when the module is stopping (shutdown/devmode reload) — fails fast with a stopping error (#293)
- wasm gateway checks the outbound-WS whitelist before the duplicate-connection-id check (fail closed on permission first) (#265)
- `lk.token` `canPublishSources` values are now case-insensitive; unknown values (including `UNKNOWN`) error instead of silently minting a token that cannot publish (#309)
- Worker process no longer crashes when a message handler panics inside the timeout middleware's goroutine; the panic is recovered and surfaced as an error
- Worker consumers survive a panic in pre-handler setup (deserialization, input mapping, middleware construction) instead of permanently losing a consumer goroutine
- Wasm gateway reconnect no longer resurrects a torn-down outbound WebSocket when a close races with an in-flight reconnect; also fixed a data race between the heartbeat loop and reconnect's reassignment of the connection stop channel
- WebSocket broadcast no longer head-of-line-blocks: each connection has a bounded outbound queue with a write deadline, so one slow client can't stall the whole channel
- Data race in workflow test runner trace callback (concurrent map access from parallel nodes)
- Health endpoint documentation now matches actual paths (`/health/live`, `/health/ready`, `/health`)
- Deployment docs corrected for `sampling_rate` config field name
- Worker now reclaims idle pending messages via XAutoClaim, so failed messages are actually redelivered and dead-letter (`dead_letter.after`) and retry limits are enforced (previously pending messages were never re-processed).
- Worker pre-handler panics are now retried and dead-lettered/dropped through the normal disposition instead of being stranded in the pending-entries list (#243); panic errors now include a stack trace.
- Lifecycle/devmode hardening: a shutdown signal received during startup is now honored (stops what started, aborts the rest) instead of being swallowed until a second signal; dev-mode config reloads are serialized (the latest change wins) and awaited at shutdown so no reload callback fires into a closing system; the dev-mode file watcher now reacts to config files created under new subdirectories and to config-file deletions; a service whose creation times out is properly shut down via its plugin if it completes late (no leaked connection pool).
- New worker `retry` config (`min_idle`, `max_attempts`); without a `dead_letter` topic a repeatedly-failing message is dropped with a loud error after `max_attempts`.
- Worker ack/dead-letter disposition runs on a fresh context, so a message that fails by exhausting the handler timeout is still counted, dead-lettered, or dropped instead of retrying forever.
- Worker `dead_letter.after` defaults to `retry.max_attempts` when omitted, so a topic-only `dead_letter` config dead-letters poison messages instead of silently dropping them; an empty `dead_letter.topic` disables dead-lettering with an ERROR log instead of publishing to a stream named `""`.
- Legacy worker `retry.dlq` (documented pre-reclaim) is honored as an alias for `dead_letter.topic` instead of being silently ignored.
- Worker `min_idle` is clamped to `timeout` + 30s margin (not exactly `timeout`), so the reaper cannot reclaim a message whose consumer is still finishing or acknowledging.
- Worker reaper processes reclaimed messages with the worker's `concurrency` instead of serially, so one slow poison message no longer head-of-line-blocks redelivery.
- Worker/scheduler hardening: a worker's configured `timeout` is honored by the middleware chain (no longer capped by a shared default); the pending-message reaper claims only as many messages as it processes concurrently (closing a duplicate-execution window under contention); sub-minute schedules with distributed locking get a per-second lock key (no longer skip fires within a minute); a scheduled job that runs longer than its interval skips overlapping same-instance runs instead of self-overlapping.
- Scaffold/runtime alignment: generated route triggers now run (added a `request.*` alias to the route context and switched generators to canonical `params`/`body`); `noda auth init` and `noda migrate` accept both `db` and `postgres` plugin names; generated multi-tenant CRUD scopes by the URL path param (no cross-tenant write via request body); MCP example configs are valid (`util.jwt_sign` secret/expiry, `$ref` object form); `noda init` and the MCP scaffold refuse to overwrite existing files (`noda init --force` to override); strict expression mode accepts `$item`/`$index`.
- Engine execution safety: a workflow that times out now returns a `504`/error instead of silently reporting success on a truncated run; parallel branches failing with different error types no longer crash the process; starved AND-joins fail loudly; join classification is deterministic; alias/node-ID and duplicate workflow-ID collisions are rejected at load.
- `lk.participantUpdate` now merges `permissions` with the participant's current permission set (one extra `GetParticipant` call) instead of full-replacing it — a partial map like `{"canPublish": false}` no longer silently revokes `canSubscribe`/`canPublishData`/`hidden`. Unknown or non-boolean permission keys are now rejected instead of silently ignored.
- `auth.set_password` gained an optional `token` config that consumes a `reset_password` one-time token and updates the password in a single transaction (new `invalid` output); the scaffolded reset-password flow uses it, so a failure after token consumption (rejected password, DB error) no longer burns the reset token. Password length validation now counts characters (runes) instead of bytes, matching the scaffolded route schemas' code-point semantics.
- Quick-wins batch: wasm gateway reconnection settings are honored under msgpack encoding (`max_attempts`/`initial_delay` no longer silently coerce to zero); `wasm.send` during module shutdown can no longer trip the Go WaitGroup Add/Wait misuse panic (commands to a stopping module are dropped with a warning); the route handler's response select is now deterministic: a response the workflow already produced wins over a synthesized workflow error or response timeout, a workflow completing exactly at the response deadline gets its real outcome instead of a coin-flip 504, and a workflow error suppressed by a produced response is always logged (previously a scheduling race could return 500/504 despite a produced response); the wasm-counter and discord-bot example guest modules compile under tinygo again; the dev `/ws/trace` origin check compares hostnames case-insensitively.
- Scheduler distributed locking now keys each fire on the cron-scheduled tick time instead of the wall clock at dispatch, so two instances handling the same tick but straddling a second boundary (GC pause, load) can no longer compute different keys and both run the job.
- sub-workflow timeouts inherited from a parent deadline report the child's actual budget instead of "timeout after 0s" (#273); any TimeoutError without a duration now omits it from the message (previously "after 0s")
- `{{ request.raw_body }}` now mirrors `{{ raw_body }}` on the request alias (#275)
- dev-mode shutdown no longer waits unboundedly for a stuck in-flight reload — bounded by the lifecycle stop budget (#287)

### Security
- Edge & trace hardening: DB conflict/unavailable error bodies no longer leak driver/constraint detail in production (detail gated behind dev mode); trace redaction now covers slice-typed node data (e.g. `db.query` rows) and `stream_key`; the dev `/ws/trace` endpoint rejects cross-origin connections; `response.redirect` rejects `/\`-authority open redirects; `ws.send`/`sse.send` (and the Wasm host connection API) reject wildcard channels — **broadcasting via a wildcard send is no longer supported; subscribe connections to a shared literal channel instead**; `image.resize`/`crop`/`thumbnail` cap output dimensions.
- Bumped `github.com/buger/jsonparser` v1.1.1 → v1.1.2 (GO-2026-4514, DoS in the parser; the package is imported transitively but the vulnerable symbol is not called) and `golang.org/x/crypto` v0.51.0 → v0.53.0 (clears 13 module-level `ssh/*` advisories; `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` is not imported, so there was no call-path exposure — `argon2`/`bcrypt` used by auth are unchanged). `govulncheck` reports no vulnerabilities.
- Auth scaffold anti-enumeration: `noda auth init` now generates a **verification-first** register flow — both a new and an already-registered email return an identical `200` with no session cookie and send an email, so registration no longer discloses which addresses exist (it no longer auto-logs-in; users verify then log in). The password-reset and resend-verification flows now respond at a **fixed ~500 ms deadline** on every branch (via `util.timestamp` + `util.delay`), so the synchronous SMTP send on the known-account path no longer leaks account existence (or verified-vs-unverified status) through response timing. For a hard guarantee, move the email send to an async worker (`event.emit` + a worker consumer). Also: `util.delay` now resolves its `timeout` per request, enabling computed delays.
- The scaffolded login flow now pads invalid-credential responses to a fixed ~500 ms deadline (`util.timestamp` + `util.delay`, same pattern as password-reset/resend-verification), closing a timing oracle that re-opened account enumeration after an argon2 cost raise: stored hashes verify at their embedded old params while unknown emails burn the new, heavier dummy hash, so wrong-password-on-real-account responded measurably faster than unknown-email. Projects scaffolded earlier should add the pad manually (see the authentication guide); if argon2 verification alone approaches 500 ms, raise the deadline.
- The trace redactor now fails closed in both situations where it cannot classify keys: past its recursion depth cap (`[REDACTED: max depth]`) and for non-string-keyed maps (`[REDACTED: unclassifiable keys]`), instead of returning the raw value — a secret nested deeper than 32 levels or inside e.g. a `map[int]any` can no longer bypass redaction.

### Removed
- Stream plugin consume-side API (`Subscribe`, `Ack`, `PendingCount`): unused by the platform (workers consume streams directly) and its hardcoded 60s reclaim conflicted with the worker reaper's timeout-clamped policy. `Publish` and the `pkg/api.StreamService` contract are unchanged.
